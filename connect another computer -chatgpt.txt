To connect to your simplified NetCat-like server from another computer, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the server is running
	• Start your server on the host computer and note its IP address and the port 
	  it’s listening on (e.g., 8989).

2. Find the server’s IP address
	• To connect within the same local network, you need the private IP address 
	  of the server:
		▪ On Linux/Mac: Run ip addr or ipconfig getifaddr en1 to find the address (usually something 
		  like 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x).
		▪ On Windows: Run ipconfig and look for the IPv4 address.
	• To connect from outside the network, you need the public IP address of the 
	  server. You can find this by searching for "what's my IP" on the host machine or 
	  using a service like https://whatismyipaddress.com.

3. Verify firewall settings
	• Ensure the port (e.g., 8989) is open and accessible:
		▪ On Linux: Use sudo ufw allow 8989 (if using UFW) or configure iptables.
		▪ On Windows: Go to "Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings" and create 
		  an inbound rule for the port.
		▪ On Mac: Allow the app in "System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall."

4. Connect from another computer
	• On the same network:
		▪ Use the private IP address of the server:
			nc <server-private-ip> 8989 		  Example:
			nc 192.168.1.5 8989
		
	• From outside the network:
		1 Forward the port (e.g., 8989) on your router to the server’s private IP.
			▪ Log into the router admin interface (usually via 192.168.1.1 or similar).
			▪ Look for "Port Forwarding" or "Virtual Server" settings.
			▪ Forward port 8989 to the server’s private IP address.
		2 Use the public IP address of the server to connect:
			nc <server-public-ip> 8989
		  Example:
			nc 203.0.113.1 8989

5. Troubleshooting
	• Connection refused: Verify that the server is running and listening on the 
	  correct port.
	• No response: Check for network restrictions (e.g., NAT issues or ISP blocks) or 
	  firewalls blocking the connection.
	• Use telnet <IP> 8989 to test if the port is open if nc fails.

6. Security Considerations
	• For external connections, limit access by configuring firewalls or using VPNs.
	• Avoid running this on unrestricted networks as it might expose the service to 
	  unwanted connections.
